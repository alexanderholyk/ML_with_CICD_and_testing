## README.md

### by Alex Holyk

This program combines a back-end API that creates movie review sentiment analysis predictions (positive or negative), which was trained on IMDB data, with a front-end streamlit dashboard that compares the distributions of reviews between testing and training data, and distribution of positive/negative reviews between testing and training data. At the bottom it shows accuracy and precision, among other stats. The dashboard also allows you to test on new reviews, and updates the charts and stats accordingly.

### How to clone and run in Docker:

- On command line, run: git clone `https://github.com/alexanderholyk/ML_monitoring_dashboard`

- Switch into the folder: `cd ML_monitoring_dashboard` or similar

- Optional: run command `make build`. If you skip this, it will be called anyway by the next step

- On command line, run: `make run` to run a container. This will show URLs for the API and Dashboard; you can copy and paste these into the browser. Alternatively, after calling `make run` you can open Postman, choose your method and endpoint (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict), and test it that way. But the intention is to focus on the streamlit dashboard, so follow that URL and you can compare the training and inference distributions and metrics.

- To terminate the program, on command line press `ctrl + c`, or you can just skip to `make clean` to delete the image and keep your system clean.








### Full Assignment Text From MLOps Class

### Assignment 4 - Model Monitoring

**Objective**: This assignment will introduce you to the MLOps practice of model monitoring. You will build a system that not only serves predictions but also actively monitors the model's performance and data integrity. You will create and run two distinct services—a FastAPI backend and a Streamlit dashboard—as separate Docker containers communicating over a shared network.

Note: This assignment is not based on Week 7 Labs

For this assignment, you need to have:

- A full understanding of the previous assignments covering FastAPI, Streamlit, and Docker.

- You will need the IMDB Dataset.csv and a trained sentiment_model.pkl file.

Due Date: 08/08/2025 

### System Architecture
You will build a multi-container application where two services run independently but communicate with each other:

1. FastAPI Prediction Service: A container running a FastAPI app that serves sentiment predictions and logs every request and response to a shared Docker volume.

2. Streamlit Monitoring Dashboard: A second container running a Streamlit app that reads the logs from the same shared volume to visualize model performance.

3. Docker Volume: A named volume to persist log data and share it between the two containers.

### The FastAPI Prediction Service:

This service should: 

- Build a simple FastAPI app with a prediction endpoint: POST /predict.

- For every request to /predict, your app must log a JSON object to a file named prediction_logs.jsonlocated in a /logs directory.

- Each log entry must be a new line in the JSON file and contain:

    - timestamp

    - request_text

    - predicted_sentiment

    - true_sentiment: This should be provided by the user through the feedback form (We won't have a frontend with a feedback form in this exercise). All requests will be mad through POSTMAN

### The Streamlit Monitoring Dashboard

(In a separate directory) This service should:

- Include a Streamlit app will that will read and parse the prediction_logs.json file from the shared /logs directory.

- The dashboard must display the following monitoring plots:

    - Data Drift Analysis: Create a histogram or density plot comparing the distribution of sentence lengths from your IMDB Dataset.csv against the lengths from the logged inference requests. 

    - Target Drift Analysis: Create a bar chart showing the distribution of predicted sentiments from the logs vs trained sentiments

    - Model Accuracy & User Feedback:

        - From the true_sentiment logged in the logs

        - Calculate and display the model's accuracy and precision based on all collected feedback.

        - Implement Alerting: If the calculated accuracy drops below 80%, display a prominent warning banner at the top of the dashboard using st.error().

### Evaluation Script

This part focuses on creating a script to systematically evaluate your API's performance.

**Create the Evaluation Script** (evaluate.py):

- Create this script in the root directory of your project.

- Use the test_data.json file: [{"text": "...", "true_label": "positive"}, ...]. (Provided at the end of this page)

- Your script must read the file, loop through each item, send the text to the running FastAPI service's /predict endpoint (e.g., at http://localhost:8000/predict), and print a final accuracy score.

- You may use the requests library from Python to do this.

### Packaging and Documentation

You will package the entire application using two separate Dockerfiles and a Makefile to orchestrate them.

1. Two Dockerfiles:

    - Create a api/Dockerfile for the FastAPI service.

    - Create a monitoring/Dockerfile for the Streamlit service.

2. Makefile: It must handle

    - build, run, and clean (to stop containers and remove the network/volume).

3. README.md: Your README must be updated to explain the new multi-container architecture and provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to use the Makefile to run the entire stack. It must also include curl examples for the API and instructions for the evaluate.py script.

### Submission

Create a new public GitHub repository (Please do not use the ones created for previous assignments; else you will lose points)

 

Use this file to provide test inputs through your evaluate.py script (rather than having to type it all with POSTMAN) --> test.json
